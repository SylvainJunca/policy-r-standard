# policy-r-standard

This is the solution for the standard exercise

## Requirements

You need node installed on your computer, see https://nodejs.org

## Dev Dependencies

    "@types/jest": "^29.5.8",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^6.10.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^6.10.0",
    "eslint": "^8.53.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb-base": "^15.0.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb-typescript": "^17.1.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.3",
    "ts-jest": "^29.1.1",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2"

## Installation

Open your terminal and in your working folder type  
`$ git clone git@github.com:SylvainJunca/policy-r-standard.git`

Move inside the project folder and install the dependencies  
`$ cd policy-r-standard`  
`$ npm install`

From there, you can:

- Run the test suite with:  
  `$ npm run test`

- Launch the program from the terminal to test the modThree function with:  
  `$ npm run execute`

## Development

If you want to build on top of what has been done, you can run the command:  
`$ npm run dev`

This will run the test suite every time you save a file from the project. I would advise on turning on formatting on save in your IDE.
